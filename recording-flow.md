# Recording Flow

So here's the steps you'll want to go through before and after each session and a few other things during key points throughout the day.

### Before

- Load in the Playback Mask for the next session
- If you unplugged any input devices, make sure everything's plugged back in, and the OBS sources are pointing to the right device.
- Start the recording before the session starts. We'll be trimming the clips anyways.

### During

- Listen in on the audio from the headphones, just to make sure everything's good. Everything should be good, but tweak the knobs if need be.

### After

- Push "Stop Recording" ðŸ™ƒ
- Wait a minute, then open the video file that was just recorded. Make sure it plays and you can hear the audio and see the video (if there's a problem with the file, there's nothign we can do to fix it, but at least we know ...)
- If the video file is all gucci, transfer it to the external hard drive. You can delete it from your file system to free up space for the next session.
- If there was an issue with the video file, just leave it where it is. Maybe it'll magically recover by the end of the day.

### Lunch Break

- The HDMI capture card and HDMI-ethernet reciever/extender get pretty hot. Unplug them during the lunch break to let them cool off and catch a breather. Just make sure to plug them back in and reconfigure the inputs well before the next session starts.
- Eat LUNCH!

## Troubleshooting

- Sometimes the Web Cam can be a little laggy. If this seems to be the case, unplug and plug back in each of the following items one at a time: ethernet cable (both ends), receiver, emitter, Web Cam. Hopefully we'll have any such kinks worked out before we get started.
- If there's an audio problem, call Todd
- If there's any other issue, call Hayden

### Audio Backup

- If for some reason there's an issue with the venue's audio setup and there's no audio coming over the loudspeakers as well as no audio input coming from the mixer, we have a lapel mic we can use as back up in one room. We'll have our mic tested in the morning and on standby in case this happens. Todd will also bring a portable recorder as a backup that can be used in any room.
