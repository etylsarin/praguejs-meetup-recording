# Best Practices

## Logistics

Try to get as much info as possible about a venue beforehand. Here are some questions you might want to ask:

- How many power outlets are in the meeting place, and how accessible are they?
- How is your projector or projector system set up? How is the HDMI input to the projector set up? Is there a wired podium that allows for an HDMI input or is there simply an HDMI cable straight from the projector to the video source?
- Is there any audio system in place that we can/should use? If so, would we be able to have access to the sound board or otherwise get an audio output signal via XLR?
- How long is your meeting place? (from front to back)
- Are there any extra tables and chairs we can use? (for setting up your recording laptop)

This list is by no means exhaustive.

It's also helpful to have a couple committed members of the group that can help setup, clean up, or record.

## Cables

It never hurts to have spare cables on hand, in particular HDMI and XLR cables. You never know when one of these might fail. It might also be a good idea to have good quality HDMI to all-the-things (mostly micro HDMI and USB-C) adapters in case the presenter doesn't bring their own adapter (FAIL) or their adapter is crap.

If you need batteries for anything, keep extra batteries on hand.

Also keep your Ethernet termination supplies handy. You never know when you might need to re-terminate a faulty cable.

The moral of the story is, "It's better to have and not need it than to need it and not have it." (I'll give you that one for free).

With the exception of maybe power cables, Wrap your cables [over-under style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg6uIZErSuY). It's disputed whether or not you should wrap power cables over-under, but that's besides the point. Wrap them however you want. But XLR cables *must* be over-under to prevent introducing bends or twists in your cable. Take care of your cables and your cables will take care of you.

I've never done this, but if you're really paranoid, you might also want to keep a multi-meter handy. It would help you diagnose the point of failure when things are working.

## Recording Computer

Be sure to close any power/CPU hungry apps when running OBS. Docker for desktop, Slack, VS Code, Spotify, Chrome, etc. Also, keep your laptop on charge while recording. If not, you *will* run out of battery while using OBS.

After the fact, keep your recordings organized, preferably on some external drive. There's probably no good reason to keep the original footage once you have your final, edited, and compressed version.
