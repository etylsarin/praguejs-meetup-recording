# Recording and Streaming

So here's the steps you'll want to go through before and after each session and a few other things during key points throughout the day.

### Before

- Load in the Playback Mask for the next session
- If you unplugged any input devices, make sure everything's plugged back in, and the OBS sources are pointing to the right device.
- Start the recording before the session starts. We'll be trimming the clips anyways.

### During

- Listen in on the audio from the headphones, just to make sure everything's good. Everything should be good, but tweak the knobs if need be.

### After

- Push "Stop Recording" ðŸ™ƒ
- Wait a minute, then open the video file that was just recorded. Make sure it plays and you can hear the audio and see the video (if there's a problem with the file, there's nothing we can do to fix it, but at least we know ...)
- If the video file is all gucci, transfer it to the external hard drive. You can delete it from your file system to free up space for the next session.
- If there was an issue with the video file, just leave it where it is. Maybe it'll magically recover by the end of the day.

## Troubleshooting

- Sometimes the Web Cam can be a little laggy. If this seems to be the case, unplug and plug back in each of the following items one at a time: ethernet cable (both ends), receiver, emitter, Web Cam. Hopefully we'll have any such kinks worked out before we get started.
